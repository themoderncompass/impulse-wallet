## Understanding Impulse Wallet

### What Is Impulse Wallet?

Impulse Wallet is your personal accountability partner that transforms self-control into a simple, gamified experience. Instead of complex habit tracking that overwhelms you, we use a straightforward virtual wallet system where:

- **Good choices = +$1 deposits**
- **Giving in to impulses = -$1 withdrawals**
- **Weekly focus areas keep you directed**
- **Accountability rooms provide gentle peer support**

### Core Philosophy

We believe that:
- **Simplicity beats complexity** - One dollar up or down is instantly clear
- **Fresh starts matter** - Your wallet resets every Monday
- **Accountability works** - You're 65% more likely to succeed with gentle peer support
- **Progress over perfection** - It's about building momentum, not being flawless
- **Privacy is essential** - No email required, anonymous usernames, all rooms private by default for your security and peace of mind

## Getting Started Solo

### First Visit Walkthrough

**Step 1: Room Creation/Joining Interface**
When you first visit, you'll see the main interface with two key fields:
- **üè† Room Name (yours)**: Choose a memorable name for your room like "FAMILY", "WORK", or "GYM" (or leave empty for auto-generated)
- **üîë Invite Code (theirs)**: Enter the invite code someone shared with you to join their existing room

You can either create your own private room OR join someone else's room - the interface handles both seamlessly.

![First Screen Interface](screenshots/first-screen-interface.png)
*The initial create/join room interface - your entry point to Impulse Wallet*

**Step 2: Anonymous Account Creation**
Behind the scenes, we automatically create an anonymous account for you using:
- A secure UUID stored in your browser
- No email required - you can use any display name you prefer (real name or pseudonym)
- All your data stays with this anonymous ID

**Step 3: Your Empty Wallet**
Once you set up or join a room, you'll see the main wallet interface with:
- **$0 balance** - Fresh start!
- **No focus areas** - You can set these up by clicking "Weekly Focus"
- **Action buttons** - Ready for deposits (+$1) and withdrawals (-$1)
- **Instructions button** - Quick access to system overview

### Setting Up Focus Areas

**Why Focus Areas Matter:**
Focus areas give your daily actions meaning and direction, but remember - they're completely private to you. Other room members can't see your specific focus areas, only your overall progress.

**Important: Actions Can Go Beyond Focus Areas**
Your deposits and withdrawals don't have to connect to your focus areas! If something positive happens in any area of life, give yourself credit. Examples:
- Choosing Michelob Ultra over a sugary margarita
- NA beer instead of regular beer
- Any conscious positive choice, even if it's not in your tracked areas

**How to Set Them:**
1. Click the "Weekly Focus" button in the header
2. Choose 2-3 areas from our preset options:
   - **Positive areas**: Eat Healthy, Exercise, Gratitude
   - **Resistance areas**: Scrolling, Snacking, Spending, Booze, Procrastination
3. Add custom areas if needed
4. Click "Save"

![Focus Area Selection](screenshots/focus-area-selection.png)
*The weekly focus picker modal - choose 2-3 areas that matter to you this week*

**Important Notes:**
- Focus areas lock for the week and reset every Monday at 12:01 AM
- You can have up to 3 areas active at once
- Choose areas that feel achievable but meaningful

### Making Your First Transactions

**Deposit (+$1):**
1. Click the green "Deposit +$1" button
2. Add a brief note (optional but recommended)
3. Examples:
   - "Chose water over soda"
   - "10-minute walk"
   - "Resisted checking phone"

**Withdrawal (-$1):**
1. Click the red "Withdrawal -$1" button
2. Add a note about what happened
3. Examples:
   - "Scrolled for 30 minutes"
   - "Ordered takeout instead of cooking"
   - "Skipped morning routine"

**The 15-Minute Grace Period:**
Made a mistake? Click "Undo last (15 min)" to reverse your most recent transaction within 15 minutes.

## The Virtual Wallet System

### How the Dollar System Works

**Simple Decision Framework:**
Every choice becomes a simple question: "Is this a +$1 or -$1 moment?"

**The "Intentional Effort" Concept:**
Every $1 should represent conscious effort, not routine habits. If something has become automatic and requires no effort (like intermittent fasting you've done for months), it doesn't earn a deposit. Focus on choices that require intentional decision-making.

**Logging Beyond Focus Areas:**
Your deposits can come from ANY positive choice in life, not just your selected focus areas. Examples:
- Choosing a healthier drink option at dinner
- Taking the stairs instead of elevator
- Being kind to a difficult person
- Any moment where you choose the better option

**Deposit Examples (+$1):**
- ‚úÖ Choosing a healthy snack
- ‚úÖ Doing a planned workout
- ‚úÖ Finishing a work task instead of procrastinating
- ‚úÖ Practicing gratitude
- ‚úÖ Resisting an impulse buy
- ‚úÖ Limiting social media time

**Withdrawal Examples (-$1):**
- ‚ùå Eating junk food when you planned to eat healthy
- ‚ùå Skipping exercise
- ‚ùå Procrastinating on important tasks
- ‚ùå Mindless scrolling
- ‚ùå Impulse purchases
- ‚ùå Breaking commitments to yourself

### Balance & Streaks

**Your Balance:**
- Starts at $0 each Monday
- Can go positive or negative
- Represents your overall momentum for the week

**Streak Tracking:**
- **Positive streaks**: Consecutive deposits without withdrawals
- **Recovery**: Withdrawals reset your streak but don't erase progress
- **Focus**: Streaks measure consistency, not perfection

### Weekly Reset System

**Every Monday at 12:01 AM:**
- Your balance returns to $0
- Streaks reset
- You can choose new focus areas
- Fresh start with lessons learned

**Why Weekly Resets Work:**
- Prevents long-term shame spirals
- Allows for life's natural ups and downs
- Keeps the system feeling fresh and achievable
- Aligns with natural weekly rhythms

---

## Weekly Focus Areas

### Choosing Effective Focus Areas

**The 2-3 Rule:**
Choose 2-3 areas maximum. More areas lead to decision fatigue and tracking overwhelm.

**Positive vs. Resistance Areas:**
- **Positive**: Things you want to do more (Exercise, Gratitude)
- **Resistance**: Things you want to do less (Scrolling, Snacking)
- **Mix**: Choose a combination that feels balanced

**Area Categories:**

**Health & Wellness:**
- Eat Healthy
- Exercise
- Sleep routine
- Hydration
- Meditation/mindfulness

**Productivity:**
- Work focus
- Procrastination resistance
- Learning/reading
- Organization
- Digital boundaries

**Social & Emotional:**
- Gratitude practice
- Relationship building
- Communication
- Self-care
- Stress management

**Financial:**
- Spending control
- Saving habits
- Budget adherence
- Impulse purchase resistance

### Custom Focus Areas

**Adding Custom Areas:**
1. In the Weekly Focus modal, use the "Add a custom area" field
2. Keep it specific and actionable
3. Frame it positively when possible

**Good Custom Examples:**
- "Morning pages writing"
- "Call family weekly"
- "Meal prep Sunday"
- "10 minutes tidying"

**Avoid These:**
- Too vague: "Be better"
- Too many areas at once
- Overly complex requirements

### Weekly Balance Strategy: The $20 Pattern

**Understanding Your Balance Patterns:**
Your weekly balance tells a story about your goals and self-expectations.

**If you're hitting +$20 every week:**
- Your goals might be too easy
- You're not pushing yourself forward enough
- Consider adding more challenging focus areas
- Look for areas where you can stretch yourself

**If you're hitting -$20 every week:**
- Re-evaluate your focus areas - you might be too hard on yourself
- Consider if your areas are realistic for your current life situation
- Add "quick hit" positive focus areas to balance challenging ones
- Remember: progress over perfection

**The Sweet Spot:**
Aim for a balance that fluctuates week to week, sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but always teaching you something about your patterns and growth edges.

### Focus Area Strategy: Quick Hits vs. Challenges

**Balancing Your Focus Areas:**
When struggling with challenging areas (like "eating healthy" where you might hit -$1 frequently), add "quick hit" positive areas to maintain momentum.

**Quick Hit Examples:**
- "Tell myself something I like about myself" (2-minute task, multiple times daily)
- "Practice gratitude" (can be done anywhere, anytime)
- "Take three deep breaths" (instant positive action)
- "Send a kind text to someone" (quick, meaningful action)
- "Drink a full glass of water" (simple health win)

**Why Quick Hits Work:**
- They provide easy +$1 opportunities to balance out challenging areas
- Build positive momentum when facing difficult behavior changes
- Create successful patterns that support bigger goals
- Prevent discouragement from repeatedly hitting -$1 on harder areas

**Strategic Combinations:**
- Week with "Stop Scrolling" (-$1 heavy)? Add "Gratitude practice" (+$1 easy)
- Week with "Exercise daily" (challenging)? Add "Morning affirmation" (achievable)
- Week with "No impulse buying" (hard)? Add "Compliment someone" (simple)

## Creating & Managing Rooms

### Why Use Accountability Rooms?

**The Power of Gentle Accountability:**
- **65% higher success rate** when someone knows your goals
- **Motivation through visibility** without judgment
- **Shared momentum** when you see others succeeding
- **Support system** for tough moments
- **Private, trusted spaces** where you feel safe to be vulnerable about your growth

### Creating Your First Room

**Step 1: Create Your Private Room**
1. In the main interface, enter a memorable room name in the "üè† Room Name (yours)" field (like "FAMILY", "WORK", "GYM") or leave empty for auto-generated
2. Enter your display name (this is what others will see)
3. Click "Create room"
4. The system automatically generates a secure 8-character invite code for your room
5. Your room is **automatically private by default** - only people with your invite code can join

**Why Privacy Matters:**
Your accountability space should feel safe and trusted. By making rooms private by default, we ensure only people you specifically invite can see your progress and participate in your journey.

**Step 2: Share Your Secure Room**
As the room creator, you can access "Room Settings" to manage your private room and share access with trusted people:

![Room Creation Flow](screenshots/room-management.png)
*The room creation and settings interface - private by default with "Make Public" option and member limits*

**Privacy Options:**
- **Private Room** (Default): Requires both room code and invite code for secure access
- **Make Public**: You can choose to make your room public, allowing anyone with just the room code to join

**Member Management:**
- **Member Limit**: Choose from 10, 25, 50, or 100 members
- **Member List**: See who's in your room
- **Remove Members**: If needed (as room creator)

**Step 3: Share Access Securely**
- **Room Name**: Your memorable room name (e.g., "FAMILY") that others will use to identify your room
- **Invite Code**: Your unique 8-character security code that grants access to your private room
- **Copy Function**: Use the copy button in Room Settings to share your invite code securely
- **Stay Private**: Keep your room private for maximum security and trust (recommended)
- **Optional**: You can choose "Make Public" later if you want open access, but private is safer

### Room Creator Responsibilities

**As the room creator, you can:**
- Manage your private room settings (member limits, "Make Public" option)
- View and manage the member list
- Share your unique invite code with trusted people
- Remove disruptive members (if necessary)
- Enjoy peace of mind knowing your room is private by default

**Understanding the Two Roles:**
- **Creating a room**: Use the "üè† Room Name (yours)" field to make your own space
- **Joining a room**: Use the "üîë Invite Code (theirs)" field to enter someone else's space

**Best Practices for Room Creators:**
- Your room starts private by default - share your invite code only with trusted people
- Set clear expectations for the group
- Only choose "Make Public" if you want open access (private is recommended)
- Be an active, positive participant
- Foster a supportive, non-judgmental environment
- Clearly explain to joiners: "Use my invite code in the invite code field, leave the room name field empty"

### Room Privacy & Security

**Privacy by Default:**
All new rooms are automatically private, requiring both codes for access. This protects your privacy and ensures only trusted people can join your accountability space.

**Room Code System:**
- **5-letter room codes** (e.g., "ABCDE")
- Generated randomly and checked for uniqueness
- Case-insensitive for easy sharing
- Required for all room access

**Invite Code System:**
- **8-character alphanumeric codes** automatically generated for every room
- Essential security layer that makes rooms private by default
- Provides secure sharing with trusted individuals
- Can be regenerated if compromised

**Data Privacy:**
- Only display names are visible to room members
- No personal information shared
- Each user maintains their anonymous UUID
- Private-by-default rooms ensure your accountability space stays trusted and secure
- You control exactly who has access to your progress through invite codes

## Joining Existing Rooms

### How to Join a Room

**Step 1: Get Room Information**
From the room creator, you'll need:
- **Room Name**: Their memorable room name (e.g., "FAMILY", "WORK", "GYM")
- **Invite Code**: Their unique 8-character security code
- **Your Display Name**: What others will see (can be anonymous)

*Note: All rooms are private by default, so you'll always need their invite code for secure access.*

**Step 2: Join Process**
1. Leave the "üè† Room Name (yours)" field **empty** (this is for creating your own room)
2. Enter the room creator's **invite code** in the "üîë Invite Code (theirs)" field
3. Enter your preferred display name
4. Click "Join"

**Important**: When joining someone's room, only use the invite code field. The room name field is for creating your own room.

**Step 3: Verification**
The system checks:
- The invite code is valid and matches an existing room
- Room isn't full (respects member limits)
- Display name isn't already taken in that room
- All security requirements are met for safe room access

### What Happens When You Join

- **Private rooms by default** mean only invited people can see your progress
- **Secure invite codes** prevent uninvited access to your accountability space

### Room Etiquette

**Be Supportive:**
- Celebrate others' successes
- Don't judge setbacks
- Offer encouragement when appropriate
- Respect different approaches to improvement

**Stay Active:**
- Regular tracking helps the whole group

**Mindset for Week 1:**

3. **Strategy**: Developing specific tactics for improvement
4. **Mastery**: Behavior becomes more automatic and positive

- **Week 2**: Aim for one intentional exercise session
- **Week 3**: Build to 3 sessions per week

### Room Dynamics

- **Lead by example**: Consistent tracking and positive attitude
- **Celebrate others**: Acknowledge successes and progress
- **Share strategies**: What's working for you might help others
- **Be vulnerable**: Honest about struggles creates connection

**Managing Room Size:**
- **Small rooms (2-5 people)**: More intimate, easier to connect
- **Medium rooms (6-15 people)**: Good balance of support and privacy
- **Large rooms (16+ people)**: More energy but less personal connection

### Advanced Strategies

**Habit Stacking with Impulse Wallet:**
- Link logging to existing habits (coffee, commute, meals)

**Integration with Other Systems:**

- Complement therapy or coaching work
- Align with fitness or productivity apps
- Export data for deeper analysis

**Seasonal and Life Adjustments:**
- **Busy periods**: Reduce to 1-2 focus areas, maintain daily logging
